    <p>Easy and quick recipe for snack</p>

    <ul>
<li>Ingredients</li>
<ul>
 <li>Meat</li>
 <li>Onion</li>
 <li>Garlick</li>
 <li>Tomato</li>
 <li>Hamburger buns</li>
 <li>Salt</li>
 <li>Cheese</li>
 <li>burger topping of choice</li>
</ul>

<li>Steps</li>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or 
        large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking. </li>
    <li>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside. </li>
    <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it
         from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the
          spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas 
          that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt. </li>
    <li>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula,
         gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain 
         patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.</li>   
</ol>
    </ul>
